# Java Pet Shop OOP Workshop

This repository contains a simple Pet Shop management system implemented in Java to help Python developers transition to Java OOP concepts.

## Overview

The code demonstrates core Java OOP principles including:
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Method Overriding
- Access Modifiers
- Basic Array Operations

## Workshop Exercises

The code contains 7 exercises marked with clear comments:

### Exercise 1-4: Implementation Patterns
These exercises can be solved by looking at similar implementations elsewhere in the code:
- Exercise 1: Complete the Cat constructor
- Exercise 2: Override the toString method in Cat class
- Exercise 3: Complete the for loop to display all pets
- Exercise 4: Complete the getWaterType method for Fish class

### Exercise 5-6: Basic Java Logic
These exercises test simple Java programming concepts:
- Exercise 5: Sell a pet and display the updated inventory
- Exercise 6: Implement instanceof checking and type casting

### Exercise 7: Challenge
A more advanced exercise to test your understanding:
- Exercise 7: Create a method to find the most expensive pet in the shop
